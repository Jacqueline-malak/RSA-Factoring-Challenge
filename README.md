# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem. This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encryption. The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption. The RSA algorithm is asymmetric.
